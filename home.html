                            Honkai: Star Rail utilizes a JRPG style turn-based combat system. You build a team of 4 Characters and take them into battle with you. In combat, Characters and enemies will act in a set turn order that is determined by their Speed stat. The Speed stat also determines how long it takes for them to act again.

                            While exploring in the overworld, attacking the roaming enemies or getting caught by them will initiate a combat sequence. Depending on the condition of how the battle was started, either your team or the enemy may suffer from a disadvantage.
                        </p>
                        <p class="paras">
                            If you initiate the combat by attacking the enemy with either a Basic Attack or Technique, then the battle will commence normally. However, if the element of the active character that is initiating the combat is one that the enemy is weak against, then your team will start the battle with the Weakness state. When starting a battle in this state, the enemy’s Toughness bar will be reduced, making it easier to Weakness Break them. Essentially, this allows your team to have an easier time with dealing damage to the enemy.
                        </p>
                        <p class="para">
                            On the other hand, if an enemy manages to catch you and you fail to hit them with either your Basic Attack or Technique ability before they make contact, then you will enter combat in the Ambushed state. In this state, the enemy will get to act before you do.

You can inflict Weakness Break on an enemy by reducing its Toughness to 0. An enemy that has been Weakness Broken will suffer additional damage and a debuff based on the element of the attack that reduced its Toughness to 0.

                            The combat system starts as soon as you locate an enemy in the game, but the actual battle only begins if you attack or get attacked by that enemy. This will play a cool animation and lead you to the combat screen where you’ll see your characters and the enemies lined up against each other.
                        </p>

                                On the combat screen, you’ll be able to see many icons, but the most important is the bar on the left where the turn lineup is shown. The top of this bar will have the character that’s currently performing an attack, and the upcoming turns will be displayed in order below them. If you change an enemy’s turn, it’ll also be shown here.
                            </p>
                            <p class="para">This bar lets you plan your attacks and support abilities accordingly. Moreover, you can use this to prioritize enemies so that you can delay damage to your characters as much as possible. You’ll also be able to see the enemy’s weakness bar on top of their health, and this mechanic is discussed in detail below.

                                    One of the most important aspects of combat in Star Rail is keeping an eye on enemy attacks. Some of these attacks can lock on to your character, apply debuffs on them, or make them fall asleep for one turn. You can see all these debuffs on your characters at the bottom of the screen, so it’s important to pay attention to that.
                                </p>

                                    At the bottom left, you’ll see a small icon with a magnifying glass on it. You can use this icon to read all the buffs and debuffs that your characters currently have. Moreover, there’ll be an icon at the top that shows a certain enemy. If you click on this icon, you can get information about each enemy and their attack pattern.
